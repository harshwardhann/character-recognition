# character-recognition
Used several machine learning models to make predictions on handwritten character datasets. Processed the data using principal component analysis to filter out noise, correct distorted images to achieve better accuracy

The models used were:
  Convolutional Neural Networks
  Support Vector Machines
  k Nearest Neighbors
  Random Forests

The images were processed using openCV. Neural Networks had the lowest error rate(<1%).
