# Character-recognition on MNIST Dataset
As part of my team's submission for a kaggle competition on MNIST dataset, we used several machine learning models to make predictions on handwritten character datasets. We processed the data using principal component analysis to filter out noise and correct rotated images to achieve better accuracy.

The models used were:
  Convolutional Neural Networks
  Support Vector Machines
  k Nearest Neighbors
  Random Forests

The dataset wes processed using openCV. Neural Networks had the lowest error rate(<1%). 

The other contributors for this project were Nandini Nayar(nn269@cornell.edu) and James Chen(jzc8@cornell.edu).
